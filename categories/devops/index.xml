      <description>Learning Puppet Hi! Recently I was reviewing two courses about Jenkins, so I had to use Vagrant for configure my environment, also I used other tools as Puppet.
In the developer day is very common configure linux servers for a lot of things: install a Jenkins, prepare the deploy environments, etc… Well, Puppet can help us to configure this servers, as a improve script shell. In this post I’m going to talk about the first steps for use Puppet.</description>
