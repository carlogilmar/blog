      <description>Recently I have the opportunity to give a conference in the Startup Week in Mexico City. So I decided talk about Internet of things, because I was learning this using an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi.
DEMO Connect Everything! The project is create a simple web application for create distribuid music. I was inspired in the Launchpad App and the Smartphone Symphony.
I planned make this using Phoenix Framework, and connect an Arduino for play the music.</description>

      <description>Learning Swift Recently I have been studying about Swift. I think that the learning experience is a wonderful resource for other persons who are in the same situation, so I consider valuable talk about this. First Steps When I start to learn swift I decide to watch videos and demonstrations about how to use the Xcode for build iOS apps, but, for be honest, I couldn’t understand some things: optionals, constrains, auto layout… This was my first experience.</description>

      <description>Follow with learning more about Ember Js as our JS framework, I have to talk about my learning experience.
When I was searching about Ember I found a lot of resources: posts, books, videos, courses and more. Everything looks good, until I had to start my first projects.
Before to start  I think that is good to know the context about it. Ember JS was born as a fork from SproutCore Framework.</description>

      <description>In the last days I have been learning about Process in Elixir. After doing some exercises and understand some things about it, I can explain how to create a simple example about process.
The Process Work with process in Elixir is so common, so, it’s important know how to use it. For create a process you can use spawn (which takes a function).
 The process structure is very simple: you have a mailbox, created within a function and by the word receive, and you can manage different messages and do something.</description>
